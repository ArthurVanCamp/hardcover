# Hardcover

_Hardcover_ is a theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).

It is a combination of the [Paperback]() and [Academic]() Hugo themes built to suit my needs.
It has the same reading experience with high contrast colors as the Paperback theme, while incorporating the features of the Academic theme that are relevant to someone in academia.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install a theme can be found in the [Hugo documentation](http://gohugo.io/themes/installing/).

## Configuration

A few parameters can be adjusted in the site config:

```toml
[params]

# your name to display by the copyright sign
# default: undefined
Author = "Firstname Lastname"

# if set to true, social links will be displayed in the footer and on the contact page
# default: undefined
SocialLinks = true

```
